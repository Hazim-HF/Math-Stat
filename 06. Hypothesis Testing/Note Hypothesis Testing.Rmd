Objective: To test whether a sample data support or reject a claim regarding a population

**Error**

Type I : We reject a true claim

Type II : We support a false claim

𝞪 = P(Type I error) = P(Reject H\_{0} \| H\_{0} is true)

𝞪 and 𝛽 has inverse relationship

We can reduce both 𝞪 and 𝛽 by increasing sample size

```{r}
library(TeachingDemos)
z.test(48.6, mu = 46, stdev = 4.2, n = 30, alternative = 'greater')
# p-value < 0.05, we reject H_{0}, there is enough evidence to reject the claim
```

A researcher wishes to test the claim that the average cost of tuition and fees at a four-year public college is **greater than** **\$5700**. She selects a random **sample of 9** four-year public colleges and finds the **mean to be \$5950**. The population **standard deviation is assumed to be \$659**. Is there evidence to support the claim at ? Use . 1.645

```{r}
# H_{0} : mu <= 5700
# H_{1} : mu > 5700
z.test(5700, mu = 5950, stdev = 659, n = 9)
# p-value > 0.05, we failed to reject H_{0}, there is not enough evidence to support the claim that the average cost of tuition and fees at a four-year public college is greater than $5700
```

A researcher claims that the average wind speed in a certain city is **8 miles per hour**. A **sample of 32** days has an average wind speed of **8.2 miles per hour** and a **standard deviation 0.6 mile per hour**. At **𝞪 = 0.05**, is there enough evidence to reject the claim? Use the p–value approach

```{r}
# H_{0} : mu = 8
# H_{1} : mu != 8
t.test(x = 8, mu = 8, sd = 0.6, n = 32, alternative = "two.sided")
```
